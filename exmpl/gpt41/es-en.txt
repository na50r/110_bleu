Resumption of the session period
I declare resumed the session period of the European Parliament, which was interrupted last Friday, 17 December, and I reiterate to Your Lordships my wish that you have had a good holiday.
As everyone has been able to see, the great "year 2000 effect" has not occurred. On the other hand, citizens of several of our countries have been victims of truly terrible natural disasters.
Your Lordships have requested a debate on the subject for the coming days, during this session period.
Pending that, and in accordance with many colleagues who have asked me, I request that we observe a minute of silence in memory of all the victims of the storms in the various countries of the European Union affected.
I invite everyone to stand to observe a minute of silence.
(The Parliament, standing, observes a minute of silence)
Madam President, a point of order.
You will know from the press and television that there have been a series of explosions and murders in Sri Lanka.
One of the people recently murdered in Sri Lanka was Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam, who visited the European Parliament a few months ago.
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the President of Sri Lanka expressing the Parliament's condolences for that and other violent deaths, asking him to do everything possible to find a peaceful reconciliation in the extremely difficult situation his country is experiencing?
Yes, Mr. Evans, I think an initiative such as the one you have just suggested would be very appropriate.
If the Assembly agrees, I will do what Mr. Evans has just suggested.
Madam President, a point of order.
I would like you to advise me on Article 143 concerning inadmissibility.
My question refers to a matter that will be discussed on Thursday, the day on which I will raise it again.
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programs is being presented to Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in section 6 regarding a form of penalties based on quotas to be applied to countries that do not annually meet their fleet reduction targets.
The report stipulates that it should be applied despite the principle of relative stability.
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of Community fisheries policies, so a proposal that subverts it is legally inadmissible.
I want to know if this type of objection can be made to what is only a report, not a legislative proposal, and if it is something I can raise on Thursday.
Your Lordship, if you so wish, you may raise this issue at that time, that is, on Thursday before the report is presented.
Madam President, coinciding with the first partial session period of this year of the European Parliament, unfortunately, in the United States, in Texas, the execution of a man sentenced to capital punishment, a young man of 34 whom we will call Hicks, is scheduled for next Thursday.
At the request of a French Member, Mr. Zimeray, a request has been submitted, signed by many, myself included, however, in accordance with the position consistently expressed by the European Parliament and by the entire European Community, I ask you to intervene with the prestige of your office and the Institution you represent before the President and the Governor of the State of Texas, Mr. Bush, who has the power to suspend the death sentence and to pardon the condemned man.
All this, in accordance with the principles we have always supported.
Thank you, Mr. Segni, I will do so most willingly.
It is, without a doubt, in line with the positions our Parliament has always adopted.
Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a case that this Parliament has dealt with time and again.
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.
We all celebrate here that the court has declared him innocent and has shown that in Russia too, access to information about the environment is a constitutional right.
However, it happens that he is going to be accused again, as the prosecutor will file an appeal.
We know and have really stated in many resolutions—precisely in the last plenary session of last year—that this is not only a legal case and that it is a mistake to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminal conduct and treason, because we, as those affected by his results, benefit from them.
Those results form the basis of the European Barents Sea programs and, for that reason, I ask you to study a draft letter that describes the most relevant facts and to make this position, which is in line with the Parliament's decisions, clear to Russia.
Yes, Mrs. Schroedter, I will gladly examine the facts related to this issue as soon as I receive your letter.
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate you for having kept your promise, since indeed in this first session period of the new year the number of channels in our offices has been drastically increased.
However, Madam President, what I had requested has not been done.
It is true that there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese, but there is still no Dutch channel and I had requested a Dutch channel, because we Dutch would also like to hear the news every month, when we are sent into this exile.
Therefore, I would like to ask you again to ensure that we can also watch a Dutch channel.
Mrs. Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this issue is on the agenda of the Quaestors' meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
I hope it will be considered in a positive spirit.
Madam President, could you tell me why this Parliament does not comply with the health and safety legislation that it has actually approved?
Why has there been no air quality test in this building since we were elected?
Why has there been no meeting of the Health and Safety Committee since 1998?
Why have we not had fire drills either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or in those of the Strasbourg Parliament?
Why are there no instructions in case of fire?
Why have the stairs not been improved since my accident?
Why are the non-smoking areas not respected?
It is totally shameful that we pass legislation and do not comply with it ourselves.
Mrs. Lynne, you are absolutely right, and I will check if these things really have not been done.
I will also submit the problem to the Board of Quaestors, and I am sure the Quaestors will do what is necessary so that we respect the rules that, indeed, we ourselves have voted for.
Madam President, Mrs. Díez González and I had submitted some questions about certain opinions, reproduced in a Spanish newspaper, of the Vice-President, Mrs. de Palacio.
The competent services have not included them on the agenda, considering that they had already been answered in a previous session.
I ask that this decision be reconsidered because this is not the case.
The questions previously answered referred to Mrs. de Palacio's intervention in a certain case file, not to those statements published in the ABC newspaper on 18 November last.
Your Lordship, we will check all this.
I confess that, for the moment, things seem a bit confusing to me.
Therefore, we will review them seriously so that everything is in order.
Madam President, I would like to know if the Parliament will issue a clear statement this week about the discontent over today's decision not to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority of this Parliament previously supported the arms embargo on Indonesia.
Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous given the situation in that country.
Therefore, Parliament must send a message, as that is the wish of the vast majority.
It is irresponsible on the part of the EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.
As people have said, the situation there is extremely precarious.
In fact, there is a risk of a military coup in the future.
We do not know what is happening there.
Why should EU arms producers benefit at the expense of innocent people?
In any case, this issue is not currently among the urgent requests for next Thursday.
Order of business
In accordance with the agenda, we proceed to examine the final draft agenda, established in accordance with Article 110 of the Rules of Procedure at the Conference of Presidents, on Thursday, 13 January.
With regard to Monday and Tuesday, there are no changes.
Wednesday:
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a statement from the Commission on its strategic objectives for the next five years be included, as well as on the administrative reform of the Commission.
I would like Mr. Barón Crespo, author of the request, to speak to justify it, if he deems it appropriate, of course.
As always, we will hear one speaker in favor and one against.
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission's political program for the entire legislature was initially a proposal from the Group of the Party of European Socialists that achieved unanimity in the Conference of Presidents in September and also the explicit acceptance of President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his investiture speech.
This commitment is important insofar as the Commission is a body that has the monopoly of initiative according to the Treaties and, therefore, basically shapes what will be the political and legislative activity of this Parliament in the next five years.
I also recall, Madam President, that this Parliament voted twice in the previous legislature its confidence in President Prodi; in this legislature it voted again in July and then, with the new Commission in office, again in September gave a vote of confidence to the entire Commission.
Therefore, there has already been enough time for the Commission to prepare its program and for us to be able to know it and explain it to the citizens.
In this sense, I recall the resolution of 15 September, in which it was recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.
The events of last week—which originated outside the Conference of Presidents and used it only to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere—raise a dilemma: either the Commission is not in a position to present that program (in which case it should clarify this.
According to the words of its President, it is in a position to do so.
Since the Commission is represented by the Vice-President, Mrs. de Palacio, I believe that before voting it would be appropriate to know the Commission's situation regarding its availability to present the program, as had been agreed); or else Parliament is not in a position to examine this program, as some seem to intend.
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would mean abdicating our responsibilities as Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method consisting of making the Commission's programmatic speech known to the political groups in writing a week in advance—and not the day before, as had been agreed—bearing in mind that the legislative program will be discussed in February, so that we could dispense with the debate, because the next day the press and the Internet would have made it known to all citizens and Parliament would no longer have to deal with the matter.
As my Group believes that a Parliament is made to listen, to debate and to reflect, we think there is no reason to justify this postponement and we believe that if the Commission is in a position to do so, we are perfectly on time to be able to restore the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed responsibly before our fellow citizens.
Therefore, the proposal made by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and which Your Lordship has mentioned is that on Wednesday the presentation of the Prodi Commission's legislative program be maintained, including within this program also the administrative reform project because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: with the excuse that there is no text, the right of the President of the Commission to speak in this Parliament is denied on the one hand and, on the other, a debate on the reform takes place without this Parliament previously knowing the texts on which it is based.
Therefore, I ask you, Madam President, to ask the Commission to state its position at this time and then to proceed to the vote.
(Applause from the PSE group)
. Madam President, I want to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has the utmost respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, among them, that of establishing its agenda.
Therefore, we respect whatever the Parliament may decide in this regard.
But I also want to make it very clear that President Prodi committed himself to Parliament to incorporate a new debate, as Mr. Barón has recalled, which is added to the annual debate on the Commission's legislative program, on the main lines of action for the next five-year period, that is, for this legislature.
I want to say, Madam President, that this debate was distinguished, in the agreement reached in September, from the annual presentation of the Commission's legislative program.
And I want to say, Madam President, that, on the part of the Commission, we are prepared and willing to have that debate whenever appropriate, that we were prepared to hold it this week, as was initially agreed, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to the parliamentary groups.
Therefore, Madam President, I want to reiterate that, on our part, we have debated the action program for the next five years and that we are prepared to, whenever Parliament so decides—this very week if that is the decision—come to present the program for the next five years and, next month, the program for the year 2000, which was what was perfectly agreed.
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists to re-include the Commission's statement on its strategic objectives.
(The Parliament rejects the request) The President.
On the subject of Wednesday, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on the capital tax.
The PPE-DE group requests that this item be removed from the agenda.
Will any colleague take the floor on behalf of the group to justify this request?
Madam President, I hear some laughter among the Socialists.
I have been told that broad circles of the Socialist Group also welcome the removal of this item from the agenda, since in the vote held in the Conference of Presidents the vote of the competent working group of our colleagues from the Socialist Group was missing.
I do not know if this information is correct, but we as the PPE/DE Group would in any case appreciate the removal of this item, since Parliament has already dealt with this issue many times.
There are also agreements against such a tax.
