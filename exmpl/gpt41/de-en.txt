Resumption of the session period
I declare the session period of the European Parliament, which was interrupted on Friday, 17 December, resumed, wish you once again all the best for the New Year, and hope that you had a pleasant holiday.
As you may have noticed, the much-feared "Millennium Bug" did not occur. However, citizens of some of our Member States have become victims of terrible natural disasters.
There is a desire in Parliament for a debate on this matter during this session period in the coming days.
Today, I would like to ask you—this is also the wish of some colleagues—to commemorate all victims of the storms, especially in the various countries of the European Union, with a minute of silence.
I ask you to rise for a minute of silence.
(The Parliament rises for a minute of silence.)
Madam President, on a point of order.
As you surely know from the press and television, there have been several bomb explosions in Sri Lanka with numerous fatalities.
Among the victims of the recent attacks in Sri Lanka is Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam, who visited the European Parliament only a few months ago.
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to convey in a letter to the President of Sri Lanka the Parliament's regret at the violent death of Mr. Ponnambalam and other citizens of Sri Lanka, and to urge her to do everything in her power to seek a peaceful solution to this very difficult situation?
Yes, Mr. Evans, I think such an initiative is indeed appropriate.
If the House agrees, I will follow Mr. Evans' suggestion.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Could you give me information regarding Article 143 in connection with inadmissibility?
My question concerns a matter that will be raised on Thursday, and to which I will refer again then.
On Thursday, Parliament will deal with the Cunha report on multiannual guidance programs, which in paragraph 6 proposes that countries that do not meet their fleet reduction targets should be subject to a kind of quota penalty each year.
Such penalties are to be imposed despite the principle of relative stability.
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy, and a proposal to circumvent it would be legally inadmissible.
I would like to know whether it is possible to raise an objection to a document that is merely a report and not a legislative proposal, and whether I am authorized to do so on Thursday.
Exactly then, if you wish, you can raise this question, i.e., on Thursday at the beginning of the debate on the report.
Unfortunately, the first session of the European Parliament this year coincides with the scheduled execution in the United States, in Texas, on Thursday this week, of a 34-year-old man named Hicks who has been sentenced to death.
At the request of a French member, Mr. Zimeray, a petition has already been submitted, which has been signed by many, including myself.
In line with the position now consistently taken by the European Parliament and the entire European Union, I would like to ask you to use the full influence of your office and the institution you represent with the presidential candidate and Governor of Texas, George W. Bush, who has the authority to suspend the execution of the death sentence and to pardon the convicted man.
All this is in accordance with the principles we have always defended.
Thank you very much, Mr. Segni, I will gladly do so.
That is entirely in line with the position we as Parliament have always taken.
Madam President! I would like to draw your attention to a case with which this Parliament has repeatedly dealt.
This is the case of Alexander Nikitin.
We are all pleased here that the court acquitted him and made it clear that access to environmental information is a constitutional right even in Russia.
However, it is now the case that he is to be charged again because the prosecutor is appealing.
We know—and we have established this in very many resolutions, especially during the last plenary session of the past year—that this is not just a legal case and that it is wrong to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminality and treason, because we, as those affected, benefit from his findings.
These findings are the basis for the European programs to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I ask you to review a draft letter that outlines the key facts for you and to make this position clear in Russia in accordance with the Parliament's decisions.
Ms. Schroedter, I am happy to review the relevant facts when your letter is available to me.
Madam President, first of all, thank you very much for keeping your word and for the fact that now, in the first session period of the new year, the range of television programs in our offices has actually been greatly expanded.
Nevertheless, Madam President, my request has not been met.
Although we can now receive two Finnish and one Portuguese channel, we still cannot receive a Dutch channel. But I had asked you for a Dutch program, because we Dutch also want to follow the news when we are sent here into exile every month.
Therefore, I would like to ask you again to ensure that a Dutch channel is also made available.
Ms. Plooij-van Gorsel, I can inform you that this item is on the agenda of the Quaestors on Wednesday.
I hope that a decision will be made there in your favor.
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not comply with the occupational safety regulations it has adopted itself?
Why has the air quality in this building not been checked even once since our election?
Why has the occupational safety committee not met even once since 1998?
Why has there been no fire drill in either the Brussels or Strasbourg Parliament building?
Why are there no fire safety instructions?
Why was nothing done to make the stairs safer after my accident?
Why is the smoking ban not enforced in the non-smoking areas?
It is a disgrace that we adopt rules and then do not comply with them ourselves.
Ms. Lynne, you are absolutely right, and I will check whether all this is really the case.
I will also submit the question to the Quaestors. I am sure that they attach great importance to ensuring that we ourselves comply with the legal provisions we adopt.
Madam President! Ms. Díez González and I had submitted some questions regarding certain statements made by the Vice-President, Ms. de Palacio, as reported in a Spanish newspaper.
The competent services did not include them on the agenda, as they believed they had already been answered in a previous session.
I ask that this decision be reconsidered, because that is not the case.
The previously answered questions referred to Ms. de Palacio's conduct in a specific matter, not to the statements published in the daily newspaper ABC on 18 November last year.
Dear colleague, we will look into this.
However, I must tell you that I currently find the situation somewhat confusing.
But we will examine it very carefully to ensure that everything is in order.
Madam President, I would like to know whether Parliament will this week send a clear signal of our dissatisfaction regarding today's decision to reject an extension of the arms embargo against Indonesia, especially since the vast majority in this Parliament has in the past spoken out in favor of the arms embargo against Indonesia.
Today's decision against extending the embargo poses a very great danger in view of the situation there.
Parliament should, since this is the wish of the vast majority, send an appropriate message.
The rejection of an extension of the embargo by the EU Member States is irresponsible.
As has already been established, the situation in Indonesia is extremely unstable.
There is even the danger of a military coup.
We do not know what will happen.
So why should arms manufacturers in the EU make profits at the expense of innocent people?
This item is not currently scheduled for the urgent debate on Thursday.
Order of business
According to the agenda, the next item is the consideration of the final draft agenda, as established by the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, 13 January, in accordance with Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
There are no changes for Monday and Tuesday.
For Wednesday:
The Socialist Group requests that a statement by the Commission on its strategic objectives for the next five years as well as on the administrative reform of the Commission be included on the agenda.
I ask the applicant, Mr. Barón Crespo, to justify his request, if he so wishes.
After that, we will proceed as usual: one speaker in favor, one against.
Madam President! The presentation of the Prodi Commission's political program for the entire legislative period was based on a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which received the unanimous approval of the Conference of Presidents in September and also the explicit consent of President Prodi, who reaffirmed his commitment in his inaugural speech.
This commitment is significant in that the Commission is a body which, according to the Treaties, has the monopoly of initiative and thus fundamentally shapes the political and legislative activity of this Parliament over the next five years.
I would also like to remind you that this Parliament, in the previous legislative period, expressed its confidence in President Prodi twice; in this legislative period, it again expressed its confidence in him in July, and then, when the new Commission was in office, there was again a vote of confidence for the Commission as a whole in September.
Thus, the Commission has already had sufficient time to draw up its program, and we have had time to get to know it and to explain it to the citizens.
In this sense, I recall the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.
The events of the past week—which began on the sidelines of the Conference of Presidents and in which this Conference was used only to confirm and ratify decisions taken elsewhere—highlight a dilemma: Either the Commission is unable to present this program (in which case it should clarify the situation.
According to the words of its President, it is able to do so.
Since the Commission is represented by Vice-President Ms. de Palacio, I consider it appropriate, before the vote, to learn the Commission's position regarding its readiness to present the program as agreed.), or Parliament is unable to consider this program, as some apparently claim.
In my view, this second hypothesis would amount to a renunciation of our responsibility as Parliament and, moreover, to the introduction of an original thesis, an unknown method, which would consist in providing the groups with the Commission's programmatic speech in written form a week in advance—and not, as agreed, the day before—bearing in mind that the legislative program will be discussed in February, so that we could dispense with the debate, since the press and the Internet would have informed all citizens about it the next day and Parliament would have no reason to deal with the matter.
Since my group believes that a Parliament is there to listen, to discuss, and to reflect, in our view there is no justification for this delay, and we believe that if the Commission is able to do so, we are exactly on time to reinstate the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and to be able to appear responsibly before our fellow citizens.
Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which you mentioned, is to keep Wednesday as the date for the presentation of the Prodi Commission's program for the legislative period, and to include in this program the administrative reform project, since otherwise we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: with the excuse that the text is not available, the President of the Commission would be denied the right to speak in this Parliament, and on the other hand, a debate on the reform would take place without this Parliament having previously read the texts on which the debate is based.
Therefore, I ask you, Madam President, to request the Commission to state its position now, and then to proceed to the vote.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
Madam President, dear colleagues! I am somewhat surprised by the behavior of Mr. Barón Crespo, who now demands that this item be placed on the agenda for Wednesday.
Mr. Barón Crespo, you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday.
I do not criticize that; it happens from time to time that one is represented by someone else.
Mr. Hänsch represented you there.
We had a detailed debate in the Conference of Presidents.
Only your group supported what you are now saying.
We then voted.
Each chairperson has as many votes as the group has members.
There was a vote on this item.
To the best of my recollection, the vote was: 422 to 180 with a few abstentions.
That means all groups, except the non-attached members—but they are not a group—were in agreement; only your group was of the opinion to proceed as you have proposed here.
All others were of a different opinion.
That was the decision.
Now I would like to say something about the matter itself.
