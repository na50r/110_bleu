Resumption of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament, which was interrupted on Friday, 17 December, resumed. Once again, I wish you a happy New Year, and I hope you have had a good holiday.
As you can see, the great "year 2000 problem" did not materialise. On the other hand, citizens in some of the Member States have been affected by very terrible natural disasters.
You have expressed a wish for a debate on this subject during the session.
In the meantime, I wish – as some colleagues have also requested – that we observe a minute's silence in memory of the victims of, among other things, the storms in the Member States that were affected.
I urge you to observe a minute's silence standing.
(The Parliament observed a minute's silence standing)
Madam President, a point of order.
Through the press and television, you will be aware of a series of bomb explosions and murders in Sri Lanka.
One of the people who was murdered quite recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who visited the European Parliament a few months ago.
Would it be appropriate if you, Madam President, sent a letter to the President of Sri Lanka to express our deep regret at the death of Kumar Ponnambalam and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and to urgently request the President to do everything possible to achieve a peaceful solution to a very difficult situation?
Yes, Mr Evans, I believe that an initiative such as the one you propose would be very appropriate.
If the European Parliament agrees, I will do as Mr Evans has suggested.
Madam President, a point of order.
I would like your advice on Article 143 regarding rejection.
My question concerns a subject that will be dealt with on Thursday, and I would like to raise the subject again on that occasion.
The report by Cunha on multiannual development programmes is to be debated by Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in point 6 that quota sanctions should be introduced for countries that do not meet their annual targets for fleet reduction.
According to point 6, this is to be introduced despite the principle of relative stability.
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle for the common fisheries policy, and that there would be legal grounds for rejecting a proposal to undermine this principle.
I would like to know whether it is possible to object to something that is merely a report and not a legislative proposal, and whether this is something I can do on Thursday?
That is precisely where you – if you wish – can raise this question, that is, on Thursday at the beginning of the debate.
Madam President, at the same time as the European Parliament's first session period this year, the date has been set in Texas, USA, for the execution of a death row inmate, namely a young man of 34 years named Hicks, and unfortunately it is next Thursday.
At the request of a French Member of Parliament, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been submitted, which many have signed, including myself, but in line with the position that the European Parliament and the entire European Community constantly express, I ask you to use the influence you have by virtue of your office and the institution you represent, towards the President and Texas Governor Bush, who has the authority to overturn the death sentence and pardon the convicted man.
All this is in line with the principles we have always supported.
Thank you, Mr Segni, I will do so with pleasure.
It is thus entirely in line with the position the European Parliament has always taken.
Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a case that Parliament has dealt with repeatedly.
It concerns Alexander Nikitin.
We are all pleased that the court has acquitted him and emphasised that access to environmental information is also a constitutional right in Russia.
But now he is to be prosecuted again, because the public prosecutor has appealed the verdict.
We know and have established in many resolutions – precisely at the last meeting last year – that this is not just a legal case, and that it is wrong to accuse Alexander Nikitin of having committed a crime and treason, because we as those affected benefit from his results.
These results are the basis for the European programmes for the protection of the Barents Sea, and therefore I ask you to review a draft letter describing the main facts and to clarify this position in Russia in accordance with Parliament's decisions.
Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I will be happy to look into this matter when I have received your letter.
Madam President, I would first like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word, and that the number of TV channels in our offices has actually been greatly expanded now in this first session period of the new year.
But, Madam President, what I had requested has not happened.
There are now admittedly two Finnish channels and one Portuguese channel, but there is still no Dutch channel, and I had requested a Dutch channel, because the Dutch also want to keep up with the news every month when we are exiled to this place.
I would therefore once again request that you nevertheless ensure that we also get a Dutch channel.
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can inform you that this question is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.
I hope it will be dealt with in a positive spirit.
Madam President, can you tell me why Parliament does not comply with the health and safety regulations it has itself laid down?
Why has there been no investigation of the air quality in this building since we were elected?
Why has the Health and Safety Committee not had a meeting since 1998?
Why have there been no fire drills, either in the Parliament buildings in Brussels or Strasbourg?
Why are there no fire instructions?
Why are there no non-smoking areas?
It is absolutely scandalous that we lay down legislative provisions and then do not comply with them ourselves.
Mrs Lynne, you are absolutely right, and I will check whether all these things really have not been done.
I will also present the problem to the Quaestors, and I am sure that the Quaestors will strive to ensure that we comply with the legislation we adopt.
Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had asked some questions about certain views expressed in a Spanish newspaper by the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio.
The competent services have not put them on the agenda because they believe they were answered at a previous meeting.
I request that this decision be reconsidered, because that is not the case.
The questions that were previously answered concerned Mrs de Palacio's involvement in a particular case and not the statements that could be read in the newspaper ABC on 18 November last year.
Dear colleagues, we will look into all this.
I must admit that it all seems a bit confusing to me at the moment.
Therefore, we will look into it very carefully, so that everything is as it should be.
Madam President, I would like to know whether there will be a clear message from Parliament this week about our dissatisfaction with today's decision not to extend the embargo on arms exports to Indonesia, given that a large majority in Parliament has previously signed the arms embargo on Indonesia.
Today's decision not to extend the embargo is very dangerous because of the situation there.
Parliament should therefore state its position, as it is the wish of the majority.
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to extend the embargo.
As mentioned earlier, the situation is very unstable.
There is even a risk of a military coup in the future.
We do not know what will happen.
So why should arms manufacturers in the EU profit at the expense of innocent people?
In any case, the item is not currently on the agenda for the debate on current and urgent issues on Thursday.
Work programme
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission's political programme for the entire legislative period was originally a proposal from the Group of the European Social Democrats, which achieved unanimity at the Conference of Presidents in September and also Mr Prodi's explicit acceptance, and he repeated his promise in his inaugural speech.
This promise is important because the Commission is a body that has the monopoly of initiative under the Treaties and therefore fundamentally shapes Parliament's political and legislative work in the coming five years.
I would also remind you, Madam President, that Parliament twice in the previous legislative period expressed its confidence in President Prodi by vote.
In this legislative period again in July and later, with the new Commission in place, it again in September gave the whole Commission a vote of confidence.
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme, and for us to become acquainted with it and explain it to the citizens.
In this context, I would remind you of the decision of 15 September, in which it was recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.
What happened last week – and which arose outside the Conference of Presidents, where it was used solely to confirm and approve decisions that had been taken outside it – creates a dilemma: Either the Commission is not able to present the programme.
(In that case, it would be appropriate for it to inform us of this.
According to the President of the Commission, they are able to do so.
Since the Commission is represented by the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, I believe that before the vote it would be appropriate to be clear about the Commission's situation regarding its willingness to present the programme, as had been agreed.)
Or Parliament is not able to deal with this programme, as some seem to claim.
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would be the same as giving up our responsibility as a parliament and, moreover, introducing an original theory, an unknown method, which consists in giving the political groups written knowledge of the Commission's programme a week before – and not the day before, as was agreed – given that the legislative programme is to be discussed in February, so that we could skip the debate because the press and the Internet would have given all citizens knowledge of it the next day, and Parliament would no longer need to worry about the matter.
Since my group believes that a parliament exists to listen, discuss and consider, we believe that there is nothing whatsoever to justify this postponement, and we believe that if the Commission is able to do so, there is enough time for us to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and act responsibly towards our fellow citizens.
Therefore, the proposal put forward by the Group of the European Social Democrats, which you have mentioned, is that we stick to the presentation of the Prodi Commission's programme for the legislative period on Wednesday, and that this programme also includes the proposal for administrative reform, for if it does not, we may end up in a paradoxical situation: With the excuse that there is no text, the President of the Commission is on the one hand denied the right to speak in Parliament, and on the other hand, a debate on the reform is prevented from taking place, without Parliament knowing in advance the texts on which it is based.
Therefore, Madam President, I ask you to ask the Commission to state its position now, and that we then proceed to the vote.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
Madam President, dear colleagues, I am indeed somewhat astonished at our colleague Barón Crespo's behaviour. He now demands that this item be put on the agenda for Wednesday.
Mr Barón Crespo, you could not attend last Thursday at the Conference of Presidents.
I do not criticise that, for it happens from time to time that one is represented.
Mr Hänsch represented you there.
We had a thorough debate at the Conference of Presidents.
Only your group represented what you are now saying.
We then voted on it.
Each rapporteur has as many votes as there are members in the group.
There was a vote on this item.
As far as I remember, the vote was as follows: 422 against 180 votes and a few abstentions.
That is, all groups except the non-attached – but they do not constitute a group – agreed, only your group thought one should act as you have proposed here.
All others thought otherwise.
That was the decision.
Now I would like to say something on the matter itself.
We have confidence in the Commission, in Romano Prodi, and the majority in our group has expressed confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission after a difficult process, which everyone knows about.
But we also believe that we should have a debate on the Commission's strategy in an ordinary procedure, not only on the basis of an oral explanation here in the European Parliament, but also on the basis of a document that has been decided in the Commission and which describes this programme for five years.
Such a document does not exist!
The Commission will present the programme for the year 2000 in February.
We have said that if the Commission does not want to make the programme for 2000 in January, then we will do it in February.
We have approved that.
We do not really want any conflict with the Commission, on the contrary, we believe that if possible, the Commission and Parliament should go the same way.
But Parliament is also the Commission's controller. And not everything that comes from the Commission must necessarily be in accordance with us.
I would like us to have the opportunity to prepare sensibly for a debate on the five-year programme in the groups.
You cannot prepare if you hear an explanation here and do not know at all what the content of such an explanation is.
Therefore, we recommend – and it is my impression that the Commission is also open to this idea – that we conduct the debate on the Commission's long-term programme up to 2005 in February – I also hope that the Commission has agreed on a programme by then, which it will propose to us – and that at the same time we conduct a debate on the Commission's legislative programme for 2000 in February.
It is thus also a sensible, factual context, which advises us to conduct the debate on both programmes together.
Therefore, my group most definitely rejects the proposal of the Social Democratic Group!
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
Madam President, I want to make it very clear that the Commission first and foremost has the greatest respect for Parliament's decisions, including the setting of the agenda.
Therefore, we respect Parliament's decision in this regard.
But I also want to make it very clear that Mr Prodi agreed with Parliament to introduce a new debate, which Mr Barón will probably remember, in addition to the annual debate on the Commission's legislative programme, on the main lines of action for the coming five-year period, that is, for this legislative period.
I would say, Madam President, that this debate, in the agreement reached in September, was different from the Commission's annual presentation of the legislative programme.
And I would say, Madam President, that we in the Commission are prepared and ready to participate in the debate when it is convenient, that we were ready to carry it out this week, as agreed from the beginning, on the basis that it was presented the day before in a speech to the parliamentary groups.
I would therefore repeat, Madam President, that on our part we have discussed the action programme for the coming five years, and that we are ready, when Parliament decides – this week, if that is the decision – to come and present the programme for the coming five years and next month the programme for 2000, which is entirely in accordance with the agreement.
I propose that we vote on the PSE Group's request to have a statement from the Commission on its strategic objectives re-entered on the agenda.
(The proposal was rejected) The President.
Still with regard to the agenda for Wednesday, I have a proposal concerning the oral questions on capital tax.
The PPE-DE Group wishes this item to be removed from the agenda.
Does anyone wish to speak on behalf of the group to justify this request?
Madam President, as I can hear a little laughter from the Social Democrats – I have been told that broad circles in the Social Democratic Group would also like to have this item removed from the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents there was no vote from the working group of responsible colleagues in the Social Democratic Group.
I do not know if this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would in any case be grateful if this item were cancelled, because Parliament has already dealt with this issue several times.
Decisions have also been taken against such a tax.
Therefore, my group requests that this item be removed from the agenda.
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
We will now hear Mr Wurtz, who is against the proposal.
Madam President, I would first and foremost highlight Mr Poettering's lack of consistency.
A moment ago he lectured the Social Democrats because they wanted to change a clear decision taken at the Conference of Presidents. However, he is doing the same thing.
We had a discussion, we were all – except the PPE-DE Group and the Liberal Group – in agreement, and I even noted – as you surely remember, dear co-chairs – that it was not a question of whether you are for or against the Tobin tax, but whether you dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought about it.
This is not too much to ask.
Therefore, I maintain the proposal to keep the oral question to the Commission and the Council, so that we once and for all clarify what position the two institutions have on this rather modest proposal, which nevertheless sends an important signal to the public, especially after the failure in Seattle.
We shall vote on the PPE-DE Group's request that the oral questions on capital tax be removed from the agenda.
(The proposal was rejected. 164 voted in favour, 166 voted against, and 7 abstained)
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for the publicity he has just given to this debate.
Thank you.
Madam President, is my vote, which I could not cast electronically because I do not have the card, included?
I voted in favour.
That is correct. If we add the two colleagues who have made themselves known, the result is ...
Madam President, the presidency has announced the outcome of the vote.
That cannot be changed.
Madam President, in the previous vote – and I will abide by your decision on this matter – on the question of the Commission's statement on its strategic objectives, I expressed that I would like to speak on behalf of my group before the vote.
That did not happen.
I would appreciate the opportunity to make an explanation of vote on behalf of my group in connection with the conclusion of this matter.
It is an important issue, and it would be useful for Parliament if it is indicated how the various people perceive our actions in the light of their own political analyses.
Madam President, I will not reopen the debate, but I had also registered to take a position on Mr Barón Crespo's amendment.
You did not call on me either.
I regret that, but the vote has been taken, the decision has been made, so we will leave it at that.
I regret, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox, I did not see that you requested the floor.
But in any case, I believe that the positions are very clear, and they will be entered in the minutes.
When we adopt the minutes for today tomorrow, colleagues who do not think that the positions have been sufficiently explained can request changes.
I think that is a good solution.
Of course, the minutes of tomorrow's meeting will take into account all the supplementary explanations.
I think it is a better solution than going over to explanations of vote at this point, which would be a major digression.
Mr Cox and Mr Hänsch, does this solution suit you?
Madam President, if the minutes correctly reflect my group's position in connection with the vote, I will and cannot object.
If you decide that there is no reason to make an explanation of vote, I will accept it, but with reservations.
We will therefore pay close attention to the preparation of the minutes.
We always do. If the positions are not clearly stated, we can possibly amend them.
(The agenda as thus amended was approved)
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Koch for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Council's common position with a view to adopting a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by rail, road or inland waterway (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).
Honourable Commissioner, honourable President, dear colleagues, I unreservedly welcome the Council's common position on the harmonisation of the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by rail, road or inland waterway.
Firstly, we should formally be active in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges Member States to employ safety officers or safety advisers and to organise training, courses and examinations for precisely these people without doing so explicitly.
Secondly, with this directive we achieve the following: a) increased safety both in the transport and transhipment of dangerous goods, b) elimination of distortion of competition as a result of the most diverse national training structures and training costs, and c) establishment of equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.
Thirdly, with the directive as it now stands as a common position, especially as it is limited exclusively to minimum standards, we guarantee a high degree of flexibility and limited regulation from the European Union, and we contribute to a great deal of self-responsibility in the Member States.
All this should be very much welcomed in accordance with the subsidiarity principle.
I consider our amendments from the first reading to have been met in a very satisfactory way.
They were adopted, implemented as intended or lapsed because the corresponding European provisions were not included, e.g. a sanctions system for infringements or a complicated block formation of questions.
As for the one amendment that was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and which concerns the timing of the implementation of the directive, I ask for approval.
By not setting a specific date for the Member States for the implementation of the directive, but instead granting them a period of three months after the entry into force of the directive, we introduce a flexibility clause that guarantees immediate implementation.
I ask for your approval.
Madam President, we can and must not accept that we hear more and more often about accidents causing major damage in connection with transport by road, but also by rail or inland waterway, not only, but also because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough, or because, due to ignorance or lack of training of drivers or other persons responsible for various means of transport, a major catastrophe all too often develops from a minor accident.
As an Austrian, but I think this applies to all of us, I still have fresh in my memory the catastrophe that cost many people their lives last year in the Tauern tunnel, and where for many months afterwards, with gigantic economic costs, what was destroyed in the tunnel by this fire had to be rebuilt.
The months-long renovation cut off this important transport route between Northern and Southern Europe.
The diversion traffic that has resulted from this has pushed many thousands of EU citizens to the limit of endurance.
Hell was truly let loose in some of the municipalities in my country.
Prevention must be our answer to such disasters, and with the present draft directive we are creating an important basis for well-trained safety advisers to be available, so that the right thing is done at the right time.
However, we must not be content with creating European law for greater safety.
We must also consistently ensure that our objectives are implemented by the Member States in good time, and, what is even more important, we must ensure that they are also applied.
Not yet another area where we subsequently have to regret the lack of implementation, thank you.
I would like to touch on one last point: We must not be content with closing yet another hole in the safety net and closing our eyes to the fact that there is still much more to be done in the area of road safety in Europe.
I also demand in this context and ask the responsible Commissioner present to as soon as possible present a relevant text to also in the future ensure greater safety in tunnel traffic, so that we no longer have to experience disasters of such magnitude in Europe!
Madam President, I would first and foremost like to thank Mr Koch for his report, which deals with the issue of transport safety.
The report looks at the issue of harmonising examination requirements for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous substances by road, rail and waterway.
I would like to thank him for his excellent report.
Transport safety has unfortunately been in the news recently: the Paddington train accident in London, the terrible train accident in Norway, the two air accidents involving EU citizens and the natural disaster with Erika off Brittany – all within the last four months – remind us that transport safety should never be taken for granted, and that the people who are tasked with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.
The rapporteur has pointed out to Parliament that the Council in its common position has accepted six of Parliament's 10 amendments from the first reading, and that the content of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.
My group will therefore support the common position and look forward to the legislation, which will give us yet another tool in the fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.
When it comes to safety, my group will always support initiatives to improve transport safety.
As recent events show, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in this area.
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.
First, I thank the rapporteur for his extremely precise and technical work in this matter and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has put forward.
It is about harmonising examination requirements, but in reality we are also talking about minimum requirements.
In a way, that is a pity.
The importance of safety on roads, railways or inland waterways is of course very great, and given the international nature of this transport, the training of safety advisers should also be harmonised, as should the requirements in, for example, the forthcoming new ADR Convention.
That is important, but so is enforcement, and there are of course a number of reasons why we must place particular emphasis on this.
Think of the traffic accidents in recent years. For example, in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries in fog, where lorries with dangerous substances continued to drive, even though at that time they should really have stopped at the side.
Or carriers with ships from Eastern Europe, who are alongside carriers here, and whose dangerous situations are all too obvious.
In addition, it has been shown that studies in ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan, show that 50% of containers with a partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly.
In short, it is very important.
When we look at the situation for safety advisers, companies in a number of countries have been required since 1 January this year to have such a safety adviser employed.
This is currently creating major problems with enforcement, especially in small businesses, as they cannot afford it.
They will either get rid of their cargo, or they will mix it with other cargo, and this creates a number of problems.
There is therefore also a request for a more detailed design of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses, which may be included in the ISO 9002 certificates.
The work is there, now we just need enforcement.
Let me just mention one last point.
As far as this enforcement is concerned, proper agreements must also be made with the Eastern European countries, because only from 1 July 2001, that is, in a year and a half, will they accede to the treaties concerning this.
This gives them a temporary competitive advantage.
That is not so bad, but what we should do is to prioritise in particular the safety aspects for goods by road, rail and inland waterway and as soon as possible include these, that part of the existing Community law, and present them to the applicant countries.
Madam President, here in Parliament attention is rightly drawn at regular intervals to the importance of transport safety.
The ever-increasing quantities of goods transported through Europe entail, consciously or unconsciously, all kinds of risks for staff and society.
Those who have to deal with these risks should therefore meet high standards.
The standards laid down for this purpose in another directive, 95/35/EC, seem to be sufficiently comprehensive to advise people in a responsible way on the organisation of the transport of dangerous substances.
I am pleased that there is also agreement with the Council on minimum standards for their examination, although I would have preferred that uniform, fixed standards and parts had been laid down, so that examination certificates would be the same internationally.
However, this turns out to be unfeasible.
Finally, the amendment proposed by the rapporteur is only logical, and I can therefore wholeheartedly support it.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues, I would first like to congratulate our colleague Koch on his reports, which may be technical reports, but are nevertheless of great importance for safety.
I will only make a few comments.
First, I would like to ask the Commissioner – and I am convinced that my request will be well received – that the issue of safety, whether by road, inland waterway or at sea, be given increased attention.
When I see that the Commission's first proposal was made on 19 March 1998, and that we are dealing with it today – where Parliament has reacted relatively quickly – then this period is a little too long.
It is not only the Commission's fault, but I believe that we need to react more quickly to achieve harmonisation here as well.
The second point has already been mentioned: the minimum standards.
I am in principle of the opinion that in many areas of transport we should strive for increased flexibility and provisions for the individual countries.
As far as safety is concerned, however, I am a little sceptical, because safety in, for example, Sweden is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.
I can live with these minimum standards, but I ask the Commission to monitor the situation very closely.
If this type of flexibility should create insufficient provisions in some countries, we should carry out a new harmonisation.
The third point has also already been mentioned.
Like our colleague Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a special role.
We do not want to unilaterally worsen the competitive conditions for some countries and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.
But I believe that we should do everything to keep the transport of dangerous goods as low as possible in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.
Mr President, I would first and foremost congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his excellent work and on his positive cooperation with the Commission regarding the improvement of the texts and the presentation of this report and this proposal. Finally, there is only one amendment concerning the examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by rail, road or inland waterway.
We believe that the cooperation, the joint work of the two institutions – Parliament and the Council – is important, and that the cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, specifically with the transport group, is excellent.
The common position contains virtually all the amendments that the Commission has approved, it harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers, and at the second reading we can approve the amendment concerning the date, which is much more realistic than what the Commission originally proposed, considering that we have already discussed this issue for several years.
I would also briefly like to thank the various members for their contributions and to tell you that the Commission gives high priority to safety in the transport sector.
And as Mr Simpson rightly said, one can never take the process for granted, as completed or as culminated.
The process of expanding safety margins, safety guarantees during transport, is a process that must be improved day by day.
In this context, I would also briefly address the problems with tunnels, which Mr Rack and Mr Swoboda have mentioned, and which, without doubt, for Austria are a very sensitive issue, and therefore efforts must be made to find out how their safety can be increased.
In one of the major accidents that have occurred recently, the goods transported were not in themselves dangerous.
The margarine and a few kilos of paint, which in principle did not pose any risk, created a real disaster.
Therefore, it must be examined how the requirements that can guarantee the greatest possible safety can be further improved.
Finally, I would like to say that we must look at safety in all forms of transport.
This week we are to have a debate here on safety in maritime transport because of the Erika disaster, and during the year we will discuss the objectives for safety in air transport.
But I would say, ladies and gentlemen, that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.
As I will say during the debate on Erika, we do not wait for a disaster to happen before we make an effort for safety, we work on the issue all the time, and these circumstances just show how urgent it is to find an effective solution to these types of problems.
I would once again like to thank all those who have participated in the debate, and especially the rapporteur, Mr Koch.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00.
Transport of dangerous goods by road
The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Koch for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)).
Mr President, honourable Commissioner, dear colleagues, the directive that entered into force on 1 January 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road contains some transitional provisions of temporary validity, which are linked to the completion of CEN's (the European Committee for Standardization) work on establishing certain standards.
Delays in CEN's work are now causing problems in the application of this directive.
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted in accordance with technical and industrial development.
I regret this, for we must be active because others have not done their work.
In this respect, I accept the proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC, which is under discussion today.
If the European Union did nothing, the Member States would have to change their national legal provisions for a short period, namely until CEN had completed its work, which would entail unnecessary costs and uncertainty.
The amendment to the directive, which is on the agenda today, therefore does not change the harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods that exists in the Community.
It only extends the transitional provisions by postponing agreed dates, cancels provisions that are no longer relevant, and regulates the procedures for a) ad hoc transport of dangerous goods and b) issuing less stringent national provisions, especially for the transport of very small quantities of dangerous goods in locally very limited areas.
Thus, the amendment to the directive is fully in line with the subsidiarity principle, as the Member States are given more powers.
The Commission decides whether the Member States can issue their own provisions.
In this connection, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.
The detailed conditions for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission were newly regulated by the Council decision of June 1999.
However, the proposal under discussion today to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road dates from May 1999 and could therefore not take account of the current comitology procedure (regulatory procedure).
The amendments tabled, which were unanimously approved by the committee, concern in two cases precisely this amended comitology procedure.
We want to ensure that reference is made to this already in the recitals, and that the ambiguously worded deadline within which the Council must take a decision is set at a maximum of three months.
In addition, it is pointed out that greater transparency is needed.
Another amendment makes it possible for Member States to formulate stricter requirements, especially regarding vacuum tanks, if work or transport is mainly carried out at temperatures well below -20ºC.
This is particularly in the interest of northern European regions.
A final amendment is intended to ensure that the use of tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the date on which this directive enters into force is also permitted in the future, if they are properly constructed and maintained.
Knowing that this is only a small step towards greater road safety, I ask you to approve this report.
Mr President, dear colleagues, happy New Year and millennium.
I am speaking for the first time at the plenary session, so it is exciting, almost like first love, but first love lasted longer than two minutes.
I will briefly comment on the Commission's proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.
It is good that this directive is being drawn up now, otherwise the Member States would have to change their national provisions for a very short time, in the transitional period, which would again entail unnecessary costs and once again increase people's irritation with EU bureaucracy.
However, the Commission's proposal does not take everything into account, for example, the cold climate of the northern regions.
Therefore, I have tabled some amendments, which have been adopted in our committee, to this otherwise excellent Koch report.
My amendments concern the frost resistance of tanks for the transport of dangerous goods.
According to the Commission's proposal, -20C is sufficient.
It is hard to imagine by the Mediterranean that the frost in Lapland goes much lower.
The EU is also supported in Lapland, so let us remember them.
I have therefore proposed that the frost limit be lowered to -40C.
This is necessary to maintain the existing safety level in the northern regions.
I hope that my proposal will be taken into account in the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, if you allow me, I would like to start by expressing my respect for the way you handled the flying change in the chair earlier during the debate.
In my opinion, it was excellent.
On the subject itself: I believe that Europe's citizens must be able to trust that what is transported on Europe's roads, railways, etc., if it is dangerous goods, is as safe as possible.
This directive is a contribution to that.
What we are doing today is basically a pity.
Rapporteur Koch, whom we thank for the work he has done in this connection, has pointed out that everything could actually already have come a step further if CEN had not neglected so much, which causes a lot of delay in the drafting and adaptation of the directive.
Therefore, we can only hope – and we should decide everything this week – that we finally have common rules for the transport of dangerous goods by road in 2001, so that we get legal certainty and also greater safety on our roads in this area.
Mr President, the report we are dealing with here in itself entails no major changes.
Most of the amendments are purely technical. However, it is worth emphasising that every time we make such a decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective, and it is good because it creates better conditions for the internal market to function.
Large quantities of dangerous goods are transported by road, waterway or rail throughout the EU.
It is therefore necessary to have clear rules on how this should be done.
In more and more areas, we are introducing common minimum rules for the Member States.
This is very positive, and it gives reason to thank the rapporteur, Koch, for the work he has done.
This is also important when it comes to the conditions for the internal market.
If we are to get a common transport market to function well, it is important that we not only have rules, but also that these rules are as far as possible common rules.
Finally, I would like to comment on a third matter, which is also important, namely an amendment tabled by MEP Ari Vatanen.
The conditions are different from Member State to Member State.
By approving this amendment, we take into account that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the Union.
This means that it is also necessary to take into account how material and packaging are affected by the cold.
Mr President, it is positive that in connection with this scheme we can also be flexible.
I hope that the Commission can accept this amendment.
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission, for both of them have so clearly and unequivocally committed themselves to safety in the transport sector and to the prioritisation of safety.
Mr Koch has produced an excellent report, because the work in CEN and also within the framework of the UN Economic Commission has not been carried out so quickly.
I would like to ask the Vice-President whether she can tell us today how things stand with regard to the harmonisation efforts of the two organisations, and whether the EU has the opportunity to speed up the harmonisation efforts according to the simplest possible principles.
For the following is clear: Even if we lay down unusual provisions within the European Union, traffic does not stop at these borders, it crosses them.
Therefore, far-reaching, that is, regionally far-reaching provisions are certainly meaningful.
If the Commissioner cannot do so today, is she then prepared to send information on the situation and the negotiations between CEN and the Economic Commission to the committee in writing?
Mr President, I again congratulate Mr Koch on his work on this second report, which in a way complements the debate we had in October on rail transport.
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has not been able to carry out within the set time the amendment of provisions necessary for appropriate harmonisation within the European Union.
This debate and the amendment of the current directive give us the opportunity to take into account various circumstances that reflect Europe's diversity.
A moment ago, Mr Vatanen told us about temperatures not of -20ºC, but -40ºC.
Of course, we accept that amendment, it is fully justified, and I believe it is necessary to take into account specific circumstances that reflect the climatic variation in the European Union, and which sometimes result in specific specifications and requirements when it comes to standardisation or technical characterisation.
In connection with Mr Swoboda's comments regarding the activities in CEN, I would say that we are pressing for them to speed up their work as much as possible, for it would be catastrophic if, despite the new deadline, in just over a year we were faced with the same problems because the work was not completed.
Finally, Mr President, fundamental problems have already been mentioned that justify this amendment to the directive.
We have talked about the delay in CEN, the amendment of some provisions, the link between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes, the need for greater precision.
All the contributions from the parliamentary committee and from the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which have been expressed in various amendments, namely four, have been approved by the Commission.
We therefore accept the four amendments that have been tabled.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00.
Coordination of the Structural Funds/Cohesion Fund
The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Schroedter for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Commission communication on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund – Guidelines for programmes for the period 2000-2006 (COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)).
Mr President, it is a particular pleasure for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is considered the most important issue in the part of the United Kingdom that I represent here in Parliament, namely Wales.
A large part of Wales has, as many know, achieved Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.
It is quite clear that many in Wales expect the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the problems that we will undoubtedly face.
There is increasing poverty in Wales, even more than in 1997.
The gap between rich and poor is growing.
Therefore, with the Structural Funds programme, we hope not only to achieve an industrial restructuring, but also a more general improvement of the entire economic foundation in the area concerned.
What is very damaging for us is the perception that support from the Structural Funds is due to the government's success.
Unfortunately, this is a sad recognition of the great difficulties that Wales is experiencing.
Therefore, I would like to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission should focus most on.
We expect the Commission to address issues relating to the principle of additionality.
We are dissatisfied that the figures have somehow been hidden in the figures for the United Kingdom.
We also expect the Commission to ensure that there is "matched funding" for the projects.
We hope that the Commission will challenge the British government to ensure that the private sector, which must certainly be the largest recipient of Structural Funds expenditure, is involved at the planning stage.
Finally, we ask the Commission to ensure that the money from the Structural Funds is used in a transparent way.
Far too much of what goes on in Parliament is opaque.
In this area, I believe the Commission can be a very good friend to Wales.
Mr President, our committee deals with these matters from many different aspects, and first I will talk about the aspect of research.
We believe it is very positive that the rapporteur has included in his own conclusions the proposal from our committee that research infrastructure should be expanded, especially in cohesion countries, by placing colleges and educational institutions so that they can benefit the inhabitants of the less developed regions to a greater extent and make it easier for well-educated people to stay in their home region.
This is possible through public measures, and this type of decentralisation of higher education is undoubtedly good policy for achieving more balanced development.
Another aspect that we would like to point out, especially from an industrial policy point of view, is that we would have liked the Commission, when planning the coordination of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, to take more account of the impact of growth in the use of services, electronic commerce and the Internet.
Previously, poverty and wealth were more dependent on business structures.
The regions where there were jobs in industry were rich, but today these regions may have become a burden and may be poor, so investment must also be made in new business areas, so-called electronic production and service production, for these are the business areas of the future.
This, in my opinion, has not been sufficiently taken into account in the report prepared by the committee, so on behalf of the Committee on Industrial Policy, External Economic Relations, Research and Energy, I point this out to the Commission.
Finally, as the energy committee, we had a wish that support for renewable energy sources from the Cohesion Fund and the Regional Development Fund should be more emphasised, and that in this way, through coordination, they can increase the use of renewable energy forms, so that these substantial funds can compensate for the insufficient financial resources of the energy programmes.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for her work on the report and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Flautre, who has followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but who is unfortunately ill.
I would like to draw attention to amendments 1 and 2, which were adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but not by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
These amendments concern the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support local schemes financially to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.
Parliament has previously regarded the social economy as an important potential factor for increased employment.
The amendments also reflect Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue that should be addressed constructively.
We hope that those considering rejecting the amendments have very weighty reasons, which they can explain to Parliament and to the citizens seeking employment.
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where there is a catastrophic lack of – and a colossal need for – coordination.
The Commission's proposal refers to the four employment pillars and the four action areas of the European Social Fund.
But the lack of specific guidelines is particularly regrettable, as the idea of linking support from the European Social Fund to the employment strategy will take effect for the first time in the 2000-2006 programme.
It can be said that the lack of guidelines gives the impression that the Commission also has no idea how to achieve maximum coordination between support from the European Social Fund, which is to be reviewed after 3 1/2 years, and the Member States' annual national employment plans.
We hope that the Commission can assure us that this is an oversight, which is now being addressed constructively.
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal that the Commission has presented in the exercise of its mandate is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
But I would like to point out here that this starting point draws our attention to the challenges we face: to retain the population in rural areas during the ongoing changes in the various industries, because the importance of agriculture as a source of income in rural society is constantly decreasing.
This, together with inadequate infrastructure and services and very limited and at best seasonal and little varied employment opportunities, reinforces the depopulation of rural areas.
The consequences are not long in coming.
It is the young people who disappear, they get education and find work outside the rural areas, which has an adverse effect on these areas.
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to companies establishing themselves and to the creation of new jobs.
It should not be forgotten that rural areas make up almost 4/5 of the European Union's territory.
Agriculture accounts for only 5.5% of employment in the EU.
In addition, three quarters of farmers are part-time and need solid supplementary income.
One of the most important and significant objectives that we should set ourselves in the European Union is therefore to make an effort to create new jobs in rural areas that are not agricultural in nature, in areas such as rural tourism, sport, culture, restoration of cultural heritage, establishment, conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. Although agriculture is no longer the main activity, the profession is still of significant importance, not only when it comes to preventing economic and social disintegration in rural areas and the emergence of new ghost towns, but because farmers play an important role in the management of the territory, the maintenance of biodiversity and the protection of the environment.
We therefore support an agricultural policy and a rural development policy that is consistent with the objectives we have indicated, and we support the idea that rural areas at the beginning of the 21st century should be competitive and diverse in agricultural terms and at the same time provide space for various other activities.
It is essential to prioritise overall criteria for physical planning and for population balance and to take into account the conclusions reached by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in five key areas, which have only been partially included by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism in points 16 and 17.
I will conclude by asking the Commission to take these five points into account when the conclusions on the four pillars are to be established, for I believe that maintaining the population in rural areas should be one of the European Union's priority objectives.
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues, I will begin my speech by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for the work she has done.
I think it is a very well-executed job.
And I would also like to thank her for her willingness to engage in dialogue with the rest of the political groups when compromise formulations had to be found in connection with the stream of amendments, perhaps more than expected, but they actually reflect the importance of the report we are dealing with.
For us, it is important that the Commission takes into account the conclusions adopted in Parliament, at least the spirit of them, for at this level it may seem as if we are doing a useless job here, pure rhetoric.
But the truth is that we believe, and this is also reflected in the content of the conclusions, that the Commission must take into account what is adopted in Parliament, mainly with a view to the mid-term review of these guidelines.
In our amendments, we have expressed the importance to us of creating the necessary synergy between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and the EC initiatives, so that they are used optimally, with the greatest possible benefit, in connection with the ongoing reduction of inequalities between regions and the creation of jobs, which, after all, are the two main objectives of the funds we are talking about.
And to achieve faster and more effective progress in pursuing these objectives, we believe it is necessary that those who create jobs, the enterprising and those who actually provide the new sources of employment, namely entrepreneurs, are involved in this initiative.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises must be involved in the distribution of these funds.
If this does not happen, if the entrepreneurs feel left out, if the entrepreneurs are not involved, not only in the management but also in the receipt of these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to achieve our objectives more quickly.
It is also, in order to achieve our objectives, to overcome inequalities between regions and find sources of employment, important to focus strongly on new technology, transport and communication networks and renewable energy.
And all this – mind you – with the involvement of private enterprise, which, by working together with the public authorities, where they complement each other and never hinder or exclude each other, is the one that creates prosperity in society and new jobs.
Mr President, it is my duty to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, why Wales has actually achieved Objective 1 status.
The reason is his own Conservative Party's dubious policy.
Let me also remind him that his party leader, Mr Hague, broke all the rules on the principle of additionality when he was Secretary of State for Wales, and that this gave rise to a serious letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.
I can tell you that the British government is aware of the regulatory requirements in connection with the principle of additionality and Objective 1.
I would suggest that Mr Evans read the provisions.
My group has drawn up comprehensive amendments to both reports for debate today.
I would like to focus on the importance of the guidelines.
The aim is to establish frameworks and tools to support and improve economic revitalisation, to achieve the most effective use of resources within the broadest possible partnership and to help these regions get back on their feet so that they can be disconnected from the regional respirator.
It is important to identify qualifications and potential for our regions in the high-tech sector.
This is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is losing ground to the USA in the high-tech industries of the future.
Experience with previous programmes can also show us how the guidelines should not be.
They should not create further bureaucracy.
They should not result in changes of priorities and policies halfway through the project with resulting delays and under-utilisation, especially in the light of the new budget requirement.
The implementation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of random staff, either in the Commission or in the public service.
There must be internal coherence in the Commission's directorates-general, with due regard to the specific local and regional aspects of the Commission's programmes.
The conclusion must be that we must make an effort to ensure that the guidelines are far-reaching, indicative and flexible to support our programme managers and users and to get the maximum benefit from our new revitalisation areas.
If we can create a spirit of enterprise in our poor and structurally weak regions, we can gradually recreate an environment that attracts large investors, and that is the key to future success.
That is how we will measure the success of the guidelines: Whether the EU's regional policy, with good and precise guidelines, can create new opportunities and enable poor and structurally weak regions to contribute to growth and prosperity in the EU.
