Resumption of the session period
I declare the session period of the European Parliament, which was interrupted on Friday, 17 December, resumed, wish you once again all the best for the New Year, and hope that you had a pleasant holiday.
As you may have noticed, the much-feared "Millennium Bug" did not occur. However, citizens of some of our Member States have become victims of terrible natural disasters.
There is a desire in Parliament for a debate on this matter during this session period in the coming days.
Today, I would like to ask you – this is also the wish of some colleagues – to commemorate all victims of the storms, especially in the various countries of the European Union, with a minute of silence.
I ask you to rise for a minute of silence.
(The Parliament rises for a minute of silence.)
Madam President, on a point of order.
As you surely know from the press and television, there have been several bomb explosions in Sri Lanka with numerous fatalities.
Among the victims of the recent attacks in Sri Lanka is Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam, who visited the European Parliament only a few months ago.
Would it be appropriate, Madam President, for you to convey, in a letter to the President of Sri Lanka, the Parliament's regret at the violent death of Mr. Ponnambalam and other citizens of Sri Lanka, and to urge her to do everything in her power to seek a peaceful solution to this very difficult situation?
Yes, Mr. Evans, I think such an initiative is indeed appropriate.
If the House agrees, I will follow Mr. Evans' suggestion.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Could you give me information regarding Article 143 in connection with inadmissibility?
My question concerns a matter that will be raised on Thursday, and to which I will refer again then.
On Thursday, Parliament will deal with the Cunha report on multiannual guidance programs, which in paragraph 6 proposes that countries that do not meet their fleet reduction targets should be subject to a kind of quota penalty each year.
Such penalties are to be imposed despite the principle of relative stability.
I believe that the principle of relative stability constitutes a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy, and a proposal to circumvent it would be legally inadmissible.
I would like to know whether it is possible to object to a document that is merely a report and not a legislative proposal, and whether I am authorized to do so on Thursday.
Exactly then, if you wish, you can raise this question, i.e., on Thursday at the beginning of the debate on the report.
Unfortunately, the first session of the European Parliament this year coincides with the fact that in the United States, in Texas, the execution of a 34-year-old man named Hicks, sentenced to death, is scheduled for Thursday of this week.
At the request of a French member, Mr. Zimeray, a petition has already been submitted, which has been signed by many, including myself.
However, in line with the position now consistently taken by the European Parliament and the entire European Union, I would like to ask you to use the full influence of your office and the institution you represent with the presidential candidate and Governor of Texas, George W. Bush, who is authorized to suspend the execution of the death sentence and to pardon the convicted man.
All this is in accordance with the principles we have always defended.
Thank you very much, Mr. Segni, I will gladly do so.
That is entirely in line with the position we as Parliament have always taken.
Madam President! I would like to draw your attention to a case that this Parliament has repeatedly dealt with.
This is the case of Alexander Nikitin.
We are all pleased here that the court acquitted him and made it clear that access to environmental information is a constitutional right even in Russia.
However, it is now the case that he is to be charged again because the prosecutor is appealing.
We know, and we have established in very many resolutions – especially during the last plenary session of the past year – that this is not just a legal case and that it is wrong to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminality and treason, because we, as those affected, benefit from his findings.
These findings are the basis for the European programs to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I ask you to review a draft letter that outlines the most important facts for you and to make this position clear in Russia in accordance with the Parliament's decisions.
Ms. Schroedter, I am happy to review the related facts when your letter is available to me.
Madam President, first of all, many thanks for keeping your word and for the fact that now, in the first session period of the new year, the range of television programs in our offices has actually been greatly expanded.
Nevertheless, Madam President, my request has not been met.
Although we can now receive two Finnish and one Portuguese channel, we still cannot receive a Dutch channel. But I had asked you for a Dutch program, because we Dutch also want to follow the news when we are sent here into exile every month.
Therefore, I would like to ask you again to ensure that a Dutch channel is also included.
Ms. Plooij-van Gorsel, I can inform you that this item is on the agenda of the Quaestors on Wednesday.
I hope that a decision will be made there in your favor.
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not comply with the occupational safety regulations it has adopted itself?
Why has the air quality in this building not been checked even once since our election?
Why has the occupational safety committee not met even once since 1998?
Why has there been no fire drill in either the Brussels or Strasbourg Parliament building?
Why are there no fire safety instructions?
Why was nothing done to make the stairs safer after my accident?
Why is the smoking ban not enforced in the non-smoking areas?
It is a disgrace that we adopt rules and then do not comply with them ourselves.
Ms. Lynne, you are absolutely right, and I will check whether all this is really the case.
I will also submit the question to the Quaestors. I am sure that they attach great importance to ensuring that we ourselves comply with the legal provisions we adopt.
Madam President! Ms. Díez González and I had submitted some questions regarding certain statements by Vice-President Ms. de Palacio, which were reported in a Spanish newspaper.
The competent services did not include them on the agenda, as they believed they had already been answered in a previous session.
I ask that this decision be reconsidered, because that is not the case.
The previously answered questions referred to Ms. de Palacio's conduct in a specific matter, not to the statements published in the daily newspaper ABC on 18 November of last year.
Dear colleague, we will look into this.
But I must tell you that I currently find the situation somewhat confusing.
But we will examine it very carefully to ensure everything is in order.
Madam President, I would like to know whether Parliament will this week send a clear signal of our dissatisfaction regarding today's decision to reject an extension of the arms embargo against Indonesia, especially since the vast majority in this Parliament has in the past spoken out in favor of the arms embargo against Indonesia.
Today's decision against extending the embargo poses a very great danger in view of the situation there.
Parliament should, since this reflects the wish of the vast majority, send an appropriate message.
The rejection of an extension of the embargo by the EU Member States is irresponsible.
As has already been established, the situation in Indonesia is extremely unstable.
There is even the danger of a military coup.
We do not know what will happen.
So why should arms manufacturers in the EU make profits at the expense of innocent people?
This item is not currently scheduled for the urgent debate on Thursday.
Work schedule
According to the agenda, the next item is the examination of the final draft agenda, as established by the Conference of Presidents on Thursday, 13 January, in accordance with Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
There are no changes for Monday and Tuesday.
For Wednesday:
The Socialist Group requests that a statement by the Commission on its strategic objectives for the next five years as well as on the administrative reform of the Commission be included on the agenda.
I ask the applicant, Mr. Barón Crespo, to justify his request, if he so wishes.
After that, we will proceed as usual: one speaker in favor, one against.
Madam President! The presentation of the political program of the Prodi Commission for the entire legislative period was based on a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which received the unanimous approval of the Conference of Presidents in September and also the explicit consent of President Prodi, who reaffirmed his commitment in his inaugural speech.
This commitment is significant in that the Commission is a body which, according to the Treaties, has the monopoly of initiative and thus fundamentally shapes the political and legislative activity of this Parliament over the next five years.
I would also like to remind you that this Parliament, in the previous legislative period, expressed its confidence in President Prodi twice; in this legislative period, it again expressed its confidence in him in July, and then, when the new Commission was in office, there was another vote of confidence for the Commission as a whole in September.
Thus, the Commission has already had sufficient time to draw up its program, and we have had time to get to know it and to explain it to the citizens.
In this sense, I refer to the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.
The events of the past week – which began on the sidelines of the Conference of Presidents and where this conference was used only to confirm and ratify decisions taken elsewhere – highlight a dilemma: either the Commission is not able to present this program (in which case it should clarify the situation.
According to its President, it is able to do so.
Since the Commission is represented by Vice-President Ms. de Palacio, I consider it appropriate, before the vote, to learn the Commission's position regarding its willingness to present the program as agreed.), or Parliament is not able to examine this program, as some apparently claim.
In my view, this second hypothesis would amount to a renunciation of our responsibility as Parliament and, moreover, to the introduction of an original thesis, an unknown method, which would consist in providing the groups with the Commission's programmatic speech in written form a week in advance – and not, as agreed, the day before – bearing in mind that the legislative program will be discussed in February, so that we could dispense with the debate, since the press and the Internet would have informed all citizens about it the next day and Parliament would have no reason to deal with the matter.
Since my group believes that a Parliament is there to listen, discuss, and reflect, we see no reason to justify this delay, and we believe that if the Commission is able to do so, we are exactly on time to reinstate the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and to be able to appear responsibly before our fellow citizens.
Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which you mentioned, is to keep Wednesday as the date for the presentation of the Prodi Commission's program for the legislative period, and to include in this program the administrative reform project, since otherwise we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: with the excuse that the text is not available, the President of the Commission would be denied the right to speak in this Parliament, and at the same time a debate on the reform would take place without this Parliament having previously read the texts underlying the debate.
Therefore, I ask you, Madam President, to request the Commission to state its position now, and then to proceed to the vote.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
Madam President, dear colleagues! I am somewhat surprised by the behavior of Mr. Barón Crespo, who now demands that this agenda item be placed on the agenda for Wednesday.
Mr. Barón Crespo, you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday.
I do not criticize that; it happens that one is represented by someone else.
Mr. Hänsch represented you there.
We had a detailed debate in the Conference of Presidents.
Only your group supported what you are now saying.
We then voted.
Each chairperson has as many votes as the group has members.
There was a vote on this item.
As I recall, the vote was: 422 against 180 votes, with a few abstentions.
That means all groups, except the non-attached members – but they are not a group – were in agreement; only your group was of the opinion to proceed as you have proposed here.
All others were of a different opinion.
That was the decision.
Now I would like to say something about the matter itself.
We have confidence in the Commission, in Romano Prodi, and the vast majority of our group has expressed confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission after a difficult process, as everyone knows.
But we also believe that we must conduct a debate on this strategy of the Commission in an orderly procedure, not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament, but also on the basis of a document adopted by the Commission that describes this program for five years.
There is no such document!
The Commission will present the program for the year 2000 in February.
We said, okay, if the Commission does not want to do the 2000 program in January, then we will do it in February.
We agreed to that.
We do not actually want a dispute with the Commission, but we believe that, if possible, the Commission and Parliament must go a common way.
But we as Parliament are also the controller of the Commission. And not everything that comes from the Commission has to be our opinion.
I want us to be able to prepare sensibly in the groups for a debate on the five-year program.
You cannot prepare if you hear a statement here and do not even know what the content of such a statement is.
That is why it is our recommendation – and my impression is that the Commission is also open to this idea – that we hold the debate on the Commission's long-term program up to 2005 in February – I hope the Commission will by then also agree on a program to propose to us – and that we simultaneously in February also hold the debate on the Commission's legislative program for the year 2000.
So there is also a reasonable substantive connection that advises us to conduct the debate on both programs together.
That is why my group firmly rejects the proposal of the Socialist Group!
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
I propose that we vote on the request of the Socialist Group to put the Commission's statement on its strategic objectives back on the agenda.
(Parliament rejects the request.) The President.
For Wednesday, I have another request concerning the oral question on the capital tax.
The PPE/DE Group requests that this item be removed from the agenda.
Would anyone like to justify the request on behalf of the group?
Madam President, since I hear a bit of laughter among the Socialists – I was told that large parts of the Socialist Group would also like to have this agenda item removed, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents, the vote of the working group of the responsible colleagues of the Socialist Group was not available.
I do not know whether this information is correct, but we as the EPP-ED Group would in any case be grateful if this item were removed, because Parliament has already dealt with this question several times.
There are also decisions against such a tax.
That is why my group requests that this item be removed from the agenda.
Thank you, Mr. Poettering.
We now come to Mr. Wurtz, who will speak against the request.
Madam President, I would first like to point out that what Mr. Poettering says is not entirely logical.
On the one hand, he lectures the Socialist Group because it questions a very clear and unambiguous decision of the Conference of Presidents. And now he is doing exactly the same.
We discussed, we agreed, only the EPP Group and the Liberals did not.
And I had pointed out – the other President colleagues will remember – that it is not about whether one is for or against the Tobin tax, but about whether we are willing to listen to what the Commission and the Council think about it.
That is not too much to ask.
So I repeat the proposal to maintain this oral question to the Commission and the Council, in order to finally learn the opinion of these two institutions on this relatively modest proposal, which would be an important signal to the public, especially after the excitement following the failure of the Seattle Conference.
We will now vote on the request of the PPE/DE Group to remove the oral question on the capital tax from the agenda.
(Parliament rejects the request with 164 votes in favor, 166 against, and 7 abstentions.)
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr. Poettering for beating the drum in favor of this debate.
Thank you very much.
Madam President! Was my vote counted?
I could not cast it electronically because I do not have the card.
I voted "in favor."
Indeed, if you add the two members who have spoken up, the result is ...
Madam President! The Presidency has announced the result of the vote.
Changes are not possible.
Madam President, in the earlier vote on the question of the Commission's strategy plan – do not worry, I will abide by your decision in this matter – I had requested to speak on behalf of my group before the vote.
That did not happen.
I would appreciate it if I could have the opportunity to make a statement on the vote on behalf of my group at the conclusion of this item of business.
This is an important matter.
Perhaps it would be useful to record how what we have just done is received by the individual groups in the light of their own political analysis.
Madam President! I do not want to reopen the debate, but I also asked to comment on Mr. Barón Crespo's request.
You did not call on me either.
I regret that, but the vote has been taken, the decision has been made, so let us leave it at that.
I am sorry, Mr. Hänsch and Mr. Cox.
I did not see that you had asked to speak.
But the positions have become clear and will be recorded in the minutes.
When we adopt the minutes of today's sitting tomorrow, colleagues who feel that the positions have not been made sufficiently clear can request changes.
I consider this approach appropriate.
Of course, all additional explanations will be included in the minutes of tomorrow's sitting.
I think this is better than giving long explanations of votes now.
Mr. Cox, Mr. Hänsch, do you agree?
Madam President, if it is clear from the vote how my group voted, then I will and can say nothing against it.
If you decide that I cannot make a statement on the vote, I accept that, albeit with reservations.
When drafting the minutes, we will proceed with great care. We always do so, by the way.
If positions are not correctly reflected, we can amend the minutes if necessary.
(Parliament approves the amended work schedule.)
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
According to the agenda, the next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr. Koch on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Common Position of the Council with a view to the adoption of the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum requirements for the examination of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).
Dear Madam Commissioner, dear President, dear colleagues! I welcome without reservation the Common Position of the Council on the harmonization of the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.
Firstly: We had to act formally to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges Member States to appoint dangerous goods officers or safety advisers and to organize the training, education, and examination of these persons, without specifying this explicitly.
Secondly: With this directive, we achieve a) more safety, both in the transport and handling of dangerous goods; b) a reduction of distortions of competition due to the most diverse national training structures and training costs; and c) the establishment of equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labor market.
Thirdly, with the directive as it now stands as a Common Position, especially as it is limited exclusively to minimum standards, we guarantee a high degree of flexibility and little regulation by the European Union, and we contribute to the high level of responsibility of the Member States.
All this is extremely welcome in terms of subsidiarity.
I consider our amendments from the first reading to have been very satisfactorily taken into account.
They were adopted, implemented in substance, or dropped because the corresponding European regulations were not included, e.g., a sanctions system for violations or a complicated block formation of question complexes.
For the one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timing of the implementation of the directive, I ask for your approval.
By not setting a specific date for the implementation of the directive for the Member States, but granting them a period of three months after the entry into force of the directive, we introduce a flexibility clause that ensures immediate implementation.
I ask for your approval.
Madam President! We cannot and must not accept hearing more and more often about accidents in which major damage occurs on the road, but also on the railways or waterways, not only, but also because those affected do not take the transit of dangerous goods seriously enough or because, due to ignorance or lack of training of drivers or other persons responsible for the various means of transport, a small accident all too often becomes a major catastrophe.
As an Austrian, but I think for all of us, the catastrophe is still vividly remembered that last year in the Tauern Tunnel cost many lives and where, afterwards, what was destroyed in this tunnel fire had to be rebuilt over many months at enormous financial expense.
The months-long renovation cut off this important transport route between the north and south of Europe.
The resulting detour traffic pushed many thousands of EU citizens to the limit of what was bearable.
In some communities in my country, it was really hell.
Prevention must be our answer to such catastrophes, and with the present draft directive we are creating an important basis for ensuring that well-trained safety officers are available so that the right thing can be done in time.
Of course, we must not be content with creating European law in the service of greater safety.
We must also consistently ensure that our requirements are implemented by the Member States on time, and, even more importantly, we must ensure that they are subsequently applied.
Please, not another area where we then have to complain about an implementation deficit.
I would like to address one last point: We must not be content with closing another gap in the safety net and turning a blind eye to the fact that much more needs to be done in the area of transport safety in Europe.
In this context, I also demand and ask the responsible Commissioner present to submit a corresponding text as soon as possible to ensure greater safety in tunnel traffic in the future, so that we no longer have to experience such catastrophes in Europe to this extent!
Madam President, first I would like to thank Mr. Koch for his report, which deals with transport safety.
The report deals with the harmonization of examination requirements for safety advisers working in the field of the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail, or inland waterway.
I congratulate him on his excellent report.
Transport safety has recently often made negative headlines: the railway accident near London's Paddington station, the terrible railway accident in Norway, two plane crashes in which EU citizens were harmed, and the environmental disaster caused by the Erika off the coast of Brittany are events that have occurred in the last four months alone. They make it clear that transport safety is not a matter of course and that those responsible for protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.
The rapporteur noted that the Council, in its Common Position, has adopted six of the ten amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading and that the remaining amendments of Parliament have been largely taken into account.
My group will therefore support the Common Position and welcomes the early implementation of the regulation, which will be another instrument in the fight to maximize transport safety in the EU.
Initiatives to increase transport safety are always supported by my group.
As recent events show, there is still much to be done in this area.
Madam President, allow me a few remarks.
I would like to thank both the rapporteur for his extremely meticulous and knowledgeable report and the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.
It is about harmonizing examination regulations, but actually also about minimum standards.
In a certain sense, I regret this.
Of course, transport safety on road, rail, or inland waterways is of great importance, and given the international nature of these transports, it is necessary to harmonize the training courses for safety advisers and the requirements, for example, in the upcoming new ADR.
I consider this, as well as the implementation, to be important. Of course, there are good reasons why we must pay special attention to this problem.
Think of the accidents that have occurred in recent years in road traffic. For example, in Belgium, the Netherlands, and other countries, dangerous goods transporters continued to drive despite fog and were not, as would have been necessary in view of the circumstances, parked at the roadside.
Or think of skippers of Eastern European ships who anchor here alongside others and from whom obvious dangers emanate.
In addition, inspections in Belgian, Finnish, and Japanese ports show that 50% of containers with partly dangerous cargo are not delivered properly.
In short, a serious problem.
As for the safety advisers, in some countries such an adviser has been mandatory in companies since 1 January of this year.
Implementation is currently particularly difficult in small businesses, as they cannot afford such a position.
Either they sell their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which leads to a number of problems.
Therefore, the recording of these activities in the form of annual reports or business analyses and possibly inclusion in ISO 9002 certification is also required.
The actual work is done, now it is about implementation.
Allow me one last remark.
With regard to this implementation, we must also make appropriate arrangements with the Eastern European countries, as they will only accede to the relevant agreements from 1 July 2001, i.e., in one and a half years.
This will give them temporary competitive advantages.
Although I do not find this bad in itself, we should give priority to the safety aspects of the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail, and inland waterways, take up this part of the acquis as soon as possible, and present it to the candidate countries.
Madam President, it is right that Parliament regularly deals with transport safety.
The ever-increasing volume of goods transported through Europe poses an open or hidden danger to staff and society.
Persons confronted with this danger must therefore meet high requirements.
The standards enshrined in another directive, 95/35/EC, were intended to enable people to provide responsible advice on the transport of dangerous goods.
To my delight, there is also agreement with the Council on minimum requirements for their examination, although I would have preferred uniform binding standards and regulations with the aim of internationally equivalent certificates of competence.
However, this does not seem feasible.
All in all, I consider the amendment tabled by the rapporteur to be logical in every respect and can fully support it.
Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues! I would first like to congratulate my colleague Mr. Koch on his reports, which may be technical reports, but are of great importance for safety.
I would like to make only a few comments.
First, I would like to ask the Commissioner – and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground – to pay increased attention to the issue of safety, whether on the road, on waterways, or at sea.
When I see that the Commission's first proposal was made on 19 March 1998 and we are dealing with it today – with Parliament reacting relatively quickly – then this period is a bit too long.
This is not solely the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we must react more quickly to achieve harmonization here.
The second point has already been mentioned: the minimum standards.
I am basically of the opinion that in many areas of transport we should aim for increased flexibility and country-specific regulations.
When it comes to safety, however, I am somewhat skeptical, because safety in Sweden, for example, does not differ in principle from that in Germany, Italy, or Austria.
I can live with these minimum standards, but I ask the Commission to really monitor things closely.
If this kind of flexibility should lead to inadequate regulations in some countries, then we should undertake further harmonization.
The third point has also been mentioned.
Like Mr. Rack, I come from a transit country where this issue plays a special role.
We do not want to worsen the competitive conditions unilaterally for some countries and improve them for countries like Austria or other transit countries.
But I believe that we should do everything to keep the transport of dangerous goods as low as possible, in all countries, whether transit countries or not.
Mr. President! First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, on his excellent work and his constructive cooperation with the Commission in improving the texts, presenting this report and this proposal; ultimately, there is only one amendment regarding the requirements for the examination regulations for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail, or inland waterway.
In our view, the cooperation, the joint work of the two institutions – Parliament and Commission – is important, and the cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, specifically with the transport group, is excellent.
In the Common Position, practically all the amendments accepted by the Commission were adopted, the minimum requirements for the examinations for safety advisers were harmonized, and in the second reading we can adopt the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one initially proposed by the Commission, considering that we have been discussing this issue for several years.
In short, I would also like to thank the various Members for their contributions and to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission gives priority to safety in transport.
And as Mr. Simpson rightly said, the process must never be considered as completed, as won, or as finished.
The process of increasing safety margins and guarantees in transport is a process that must be improved every day.
In this context, I would also like to briefly address the problems concerning tunnels, which were raised by Mr. Rack and Mr. Swoboda and which, in the case of Austria, are undoubtedly a very sensitive issue, so efforts must be made to find ways to increase safety.
In one of the major accidents in recent times, it was not the cargo itself that was dangerous.
The margarine and a few kilos of paint, which in principle posed no risk, caused a real catastrophe.
Therefore, it must be examined how the requirements to ensure maximum safety can be further optimized.
In conclusion, I would like to say that it is about safety in all modes of transport.
This week, due to the Erika disaster, we will have a debate here on maritime safety, and during this year we must also discuss safety objectives in air transport.
I want to express that safety is a priority objective of the Commission.
As I will say in the debate on the Erika, we do not wait for a catastrophe to deal with the safety aspect, but we work on it on the sidelines of these events. However, these events show us the urgency of an effective response to such problems.
I would like to thank all the speakers again, and especially the rapporteur, Mr. Koch.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Transport of dangerous goods by road
According to the agenda, the next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr. Koch on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)) amending Directive 94/55/EC on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to the transport of dangerous goods by road.
Mr. President, dear Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues! The directive on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains some transitional provisions whose validity is limited and linked to the completion of certain standardization work by CEN, the European Committee for Standardization.
Delays in the work of CEN are now causing problems in the application of this directive.
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to technical and industrial developments.
I regret this, because we have to act because others have not done their work.
In this respect, I accept the present proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC, which is being discussed today.
Failure to act by the European Union would oblige the Member States to amend their national legislation for a short period, namely until the completion of the work of CEN, which would cause unnecessary costs and uncertainty.
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda therefore does not change the existing harmonization of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.
It merely extends transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions that are no longer applicable, and regulates the procedures for a) ad hoc transport of dangerous goods and b) the adoption of less stringent national provisions, especially for the transport of very small quantities of dangerous goods in locally strictly limited areas.
Thus, the amendment to the directive is entirely in line with subsidiarity; the Member States are given more powers.
The EU Commission decides whether Member States can adopt certain own provisions.
It is assisted in this by a committee of experts for the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.
The modalities for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were redefined by a Council decision of June 1999.
However, the proposal for an amendment to the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, which is being discussed today, dates from May 1999 and could therefore not yet take into account the current comitology procedure.
The amendments submitted and unanimously adopted by the committee relate in two cases to precisely this changed comitology procedure.
We want to ensure that this is already mentioned in the recitals and that the ambiguously worded deadline within which the Council must take a decision is fixed at a maximum of three months.
In addition, the need for increased transparency is pointed out.
Another amendment allows Member States to impose stricter requirements, especially for vacuum tanks, when work or transport is carried out primarily at temperatures well below minus 20º C.
This is of particular interest to northern European regions.
A final amendment is intended to ensure that the use of tanks and tank vehicles put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive is still permitted if they have been properly constructed and maintained.
Knowing full well that this is only a small step towards greater transport safety, I ask you to approve this report.
Mr. President! Dear colleagues!
I wish you a happy new year and millennium. I am speaking in plenary for the first time today and find it quite exciting, a bit like first love, only that usually lasts longer than two minutes.
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission's proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road from my point of view.
I think it is good to adopt this directive now, because otherwise the Member States would have to change their legislation for a very short period, a transitional phase, which would on the one hand cause unnecessary costs and on the other hand once again cause citizens to be annoyed by EU bureaucracy.
However, the Commission's proposal does not take into account all relevant issues, such as the cold climatic conditions in the northern regions.
That is why I have tabled some amendments to Mr. Koch's basically excellent report, which have been adopted in our committee.
My amendments concern the frost resistance of containers for dangerous goods.
According to the Commission's proposal, a limit of -20 ºC would be sufficient.
It is hard to imagine at the Mediterranean that the frost in Lapland reaches much lower temperatures.
The EU is also supported in Lapland, so we must also think of the people there.
That is why I have proposed to lower the frost limit to -40 ºC.
This would also be necessary to maintain the safety level in the northern regions.
I hope that my proposal will be taken into account in tomorrow's vote.
Mr. President, if you allow me, I would first like to express my respect for the way you handled the change of chairmanship during the debate earlier.
I thought it was excellent.
On the subject: I think the citizens of Europe must be able to rely on the fact that what is transported on Europe's roads, railways, etc., especially if it is dangerous goods, is as safe as possible.
This directive is a contribution to that.
What we are doing today is basically an annoyance.
The rapporteur Koch, whom we thank for his work, has pointed out that everything could actually be a bit further along if it were not for the failure of CEN, which has been very slow in drawing up and aligning the directive.
Therefore, we can only hope – and we should decide all this this week – that by 2001 we will finally have Community rules for the transport of dangerous goods by road, so that we have a bit more legal certainty and also a bit more safety on our roads.
The report we are dealing with today basically does not bring about any major innovations, as most of the amendments are purely technical in nature.
However, it should be emphasized that such decisions always make a positive contribution to environmental protection and thus improve the conditions for the functioning of the internal market.
Large quantities of dangerous goods are transported by road, rail, and inland waterway in the EU, and for this we need effective legislation.
Now we are getting common minimum rules for all possible areas for the Member States, which is extremely welcome.
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, for his work on this issue.
This is also important for the conditions of the internal market.
For a truly functioning common transport market, we need not only legislation as such, but as uniform rules as possible.
Let me finally comment on a third point, which I also consider very important: the amendment by MEP Ari Vatanen.
The conditions in the individual Member States are very different.
By adopting this amendment, we take into account the fact that it can get very cold in the northern parts of the Union.
The effects of this cold on material and packaging must not be ignored.
Mr. President, I consider it positive that this regulation can be designed flexibly and hope that the Commission will accept this amendment.
Mr. President, I would like to thank not only my colleague Mr. Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for her clear and unequivocal commitment to safety in the transport sector and to the priority of safety.
Mr. Koch has done a good job because the work in CEN and also within the framework of the UN Economic Commission has not been done so expeditiously.
I would like to ask the Vice-President whether she can tell us today what the state of play is regarding the harmonization efforts of these two organizations, and whether the EU has the possibility to accelerate the harmonization efforts according to the simplest possible principles.
Because it is clear: Even if we make a great regulation within the European Union, transport does not stop at these borders, it goes beyond them.
Therefore, further-reaching, i.e., regionally further-reaching regulations are certainly sensible.
If the Commissioner cannot do this today, would she then be prepared to inform the committee in writing of the state of play and the state of negotiations between CEN and the Economic Commission?
Mr. President! I would like to congratulate Mr. Koch once again on his work on this other report, which in a way complements the debate in October on rail transport.
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has not been able to make the necessary regulatory changes for appropriate harmonization within the European Union in the required time.
This debate and the amendment of the currently applicable directive allow us to take into account different circumstances that reflect the diversity of our Europe.
A few moments ago, Mr. Vatanen spoke of temperatures not only below minus 20 degrees, but below minus 40 degrees.
Of course, we accept this amendment, it is completely reasonable, and I believe that specific situations must be taken into account, which are evidence of the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes, when examining standards and technical characterizations, are translated into specific definitions and concrete requirements.
On Mr. Swoboda's remarks about the work of CEN, I would like to say that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible, because it would be dramatic if, despite the new deadline, we were to face the same difficulties in just over a year because the work has not been completed.
Finally, Mr. President, the main problems that justify this amendment to the directive have already been outlined, we have addressed the delay at CEN, the amendment of some regulations, the consistency between the wording of the directive and the content of the annexes, and the need for greater precision.
All the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, which are reflected in various, specifically four, amendments, are taken up by the Commission.
We therefore accept the four amendments submitted to us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Coordination of Structural Funds/Cohesion Fund
According to the agenda, the next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Ms. Schroedter on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Communication from the Commission: The Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund – Guidelines for the programs for the period 2000-2006 (COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)).
Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that my first contribution in the European Parliament is devoted to a topic that is considered the most important issue of all in the part of the United Kingdom I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.
As you know, a considerable part of Wales has been granted Objective 1 region status under the Structural Funds program.
And so many people in Wales expect the European Structural Funds to help them overcome some of the enormous difficulties we undoubtedly face.
Poverty in Wales continues to increase, with a particularly sharp rise since 1997.
The gap between rich and poor is getting ever wider.
We therefore hope that the Structural Funds program will bring not only economic restructuring, but a broader improvement in the economic base of the region.
What is causing us great concern, however, is the fact that the granting of support under the Structural Funds is in some way being credited as a success of the government.
Yet it is only another expression of the immense difficulties facing Wales.
Therefore, I would like to draw attention to some problems to which the Commission should give priority.
We expect the Commission to pay more attention to problems related to additionality.
We believe it is wrong that the relevant figures have in some way been lost in the figures for the United Kingdom.
We expect the Commission to ensure that there is a supplementary financial contribution for the projects.
We expect it to urge the British government to ensure that the private sector, which must undoubtedly be the driving force in providing funds under the Structural Funds, is involved in planning.
Finally, we ask the Commission to ensure greater transparency in the spending of Structural Fund money.
There is a lack of transparency in much of what happens in this Parliament.
This is an area in which the Commission, in my view, can prove itself a true friend of Wales.
Mr. President! Our committee discusses the issues at hand from many different perspectives.
First, I would like to comment on the research aspect. We consider it very positive that the rapporteur has included in her conclusions our committee's proposal that in the cohesion countries, scientific infrastructure must be expanded by establishing universities and educational institutions in places where they are more accessible to the inhabitants of underdeveloped regions, and by making it easier for graduates to remain in their home regions.
This is made possible by government measures, and such decentralization of higher education is a sensible policy for balanced development.
On another issue, which we would particularly like to highlight from the perspective of industrial policy, we would have liked the Commission, in planning the coordination of the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds, to have paid more attention to the effects of the growth of the service sector, e-commerce, and the use of the Internet.
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on the economic structure.
Rich were those regions where there were jobs in industry. Now some of these regions have become problem areas and poor regions, where investment in new sectors such as electronics and services is also needed, as these are considered future-oriented areas.
In my opinion, the lead committee has not sufficiently taken this fact into account in its report, so I would like to draw the Commission's attention to this on behalf of the Industry Committee.
As the Energy Committee, we would finally have liked the promotion of renewable energies from the resources of the Cohesion and Structural Funds to have played an even greater role. In this way, through coordination, the use of these renewable energy forms could have been developed so that insufficient financial resources of the energy program could be compensated by these more extensive funds.
Mr. President, I would like to sincerely thank Ms. Schroedter for the work she has done on this topic. At the same time, I would like to state that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Ms. Flautre, who prepared the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and is unfortunately ill.
I would like to draw your attention to Amendments 1 and 2, which were submitted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but rejected by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
They concern the social economy and the need to provide "social risk capital" and financial support for local programs to create employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.
Parliament has always seen the social economy as an important potential provider of employment opportunities.
The amendments mentioned are in line with the view taken by Parliament that social exclusion is a serious problem that requires constructive measures.
We hope that those considering rejecting these amendments can give both Parliament and their job-seeking citizens good reasons for their decision.
In her report, Ms. Flautre also referred to an area where there is a great lack of coordination, even though there is considerable need for coordination.
The Commission's proposals relate to the four pillars of the employment strategy and the five areas of action of the European Social Fund.
But the lack of concrete guidelines is all the more regrettable as the idea of linking ESF interventions with the employment strategy is being implemented for the first time in the 2000-2006 planning period.
This omission certainly gives the impression that the Commission itself does not know how to achieve the most comprehensive possible coordination between the ESF interventions, which are subject to review after three and a half years, and the annual National Action Plans for Employment of the Member States.
We hope that the Commission can convince us that this is merely an oversight that will be corrected immediately.
Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! The proposal submitted by the Commission in fulfillment of its mandate is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
However, I would like to emphasize here that this starting point shows us the challenges ahead: in view of the changes in all kinds of economic activities due to the declining importance of the agricultural sector among the various sources of income in rural society, to keep the population in rural areas.
Together with the inadequacies in infrastructure and services and a generally very sparse, highly seasonal, and little diversified range of employment, they reinforce the exodus from rural areas.
The consequences are not long in coming.
It is the young people who leave, those who find education and employment outside rural areas, which has a very negative impact on these regions.
This lack of infrastructure is in turn an obstacle to the establishment of businesses and the creation of jobs.
It should be borne in mind that rural areas make up almost four-fifths of the territory of the European Union.
Agriculture accounts for only 5.5% of the Union's jobs.
In addition, three-quarters of our farmers are part-time farmers and depend on additional sources of income.
For this reason, one of the most important and far-reaching goals that we should set ourselves in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas outside the agricultural sector, including in rural tourism, sports, culture, resource rehabilitation, business conversion, new technologies, services, etc. But although agriculture no longer plays an exclusive role, it is still important, not only to prevent the economic and social decline of rural areas and the emergence of more ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in land management, preserving biodiversity, and protecting the environment.
That is why we advocate an agricultural policy and rural development that is in line with our objectives, and that rural areas at the threshold of the 21st century must be competitive and multifunctional, both in terms of the agricultural aspect and in terms of opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.
It is important to give priority to general criteria of spatial planning and balanced population structure and to take into account the conclusions reached by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in five main aspects, which have only been partially taken up by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.
In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when formulating the conclusions of the four pillars, because in my view, binding the population to rural areas must be one of the European Union's top priorities.
Mr. President, Commissioner, dear colleagues! I would like to begin my speech by thanking Ms. Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.
I think it is very good work.
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to engage in dialogue with the other groups in the search for compromise formulas in view of this avalanche of amendments; there may have been more than expected, but they actually reflect the importance of the report under discussion.
For us, it is important that the conclusions adopted by this Parliament are taken into account by the Commission, at least in essence, because at the current stage it could appear as if we are engaging in a useless, purely rhetorical activity here.
However, we are of the opinion – and this is also literally reflected in the conclusions – that the Commission must take into account the decisions of this Parliament, especially with regard to the mid-term evaluation of these guidelines.
In our amendments, we have established the importance we attach to the creation of the necessary synergies between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, and the Community initiatives, so that their application is optimally and most profitably reflected in the progressive reduction of regional disparities and the creation of jobs, which are ultimately the two main objectives of the funds under discussion here.
To give a quick and effective impetus to achieving these goals, we consider it necessary for entrepreneurs, i.e., those who create jobs, who show real entrepreneurial spirit and actually guarantee new sources of employment, to be involved in this initiative.
Above all, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs must be included in the distribution of these funds.
If, on the other hand, entrepreneurs feel sidelined, if they cannot participate – I am now saying not only in the administration, but in the receipt of these funds – we will have lost an opportunity to achieve our goals more quickly.
Equally important for achieving our goals, for overcoming regional disparities, and for creating jobs is the determined commitment to new technologies, to transport and communication networks, and to renewable energies.
And all this – mind you, with the participation of the private sector, which combines its efforts with those of the public authorities so that they complement each other and at no time hinder or exclude each other – creates social wealth and jobs.
Mr. President, I feel it is my duty to remind my colleague Mr. Evans why Wales was declared an Objective 1 region in the first place.
That is the result of the questionable policy of his party, the Conservatives.
Perhaps I may also remind him that the leader of his party, Mr. Hague, when he was Minister for Wales, violated all the rules on additionality that could be violated, and was decisively called to order in writing by Commissioner Wulf-Mathies.
I can assure you that the British government is well aware that the principle of additionality applies to Objective 1 regions.
I suggest that Mr. Evans familiarize himself again with the relevant regulation.
My group has drawn up extensive amendments to both reports under discussion today.
I think we should focus on the central role of the guidelines.
It is about creating a framework and an instrument to support and promote economic renewal, to use resources as effectively as possible and with the involvement of as many partners as possible, and to pave the way for the regions concerned to economic recovery and sustainable development, so that they can finally be weaned off financial support.
We need to find out what qualifications and potential our regions have in the high-tech sector.
This is particularly important in view of media reports that Europe is losing more and more ground to the USA in the promising high-tech growth sectors.
The implementation of the last program round is also very instructive in that it shows what the guidelines should not be about.
It should not be about creating new bureaucratic obstacles.
It should not be about making changes to priorities and policies halfway through, which inevitably leads to delays and underutilization of funds. This is particularly important in view of the new requirements for budgetary discipline.
The implementation and application of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of this or that official in the Commission or the civil service.
Within the responsible directorate of the Commission, consistency must be ensured, while at the same time the specific local and regional aspects of the Commission's programs must be taken into account.
From this, it can be deduced that we must aim for broad, indicative, and flexible guidelines on which both our program managers and the beneficiaries can rely and which contribute to maximizing the potential of the new areas of economic renewal.
If we succeed in stimulating entrepreneurial activity in our poor and structurally weak regions, we will finally be able to turn things around and significantly strengthen the confidence of investors. Then nothing will stand in the way of successful development.
The success of these guidelines will be measured by whether EU regional policy, based on good, solid, and implementable guidelines, succeeds in opening up new opportunities and ensuring that our poor and structurally weak regions can make a comprehensive contribution to growth and prosperity in the EU.
